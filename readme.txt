== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with newest WP version and also older versions? =
Yes, this plugin works fine with WordPress 4.2!
It also works great with WP 3.4 - and perhaps below - but we've only tested extensively with WP 3.4 and above. So you always should run the latest WordPress version.

= Does this plugin depend on any external sources? =
Yes, the plugin will call a JavaScript file from Hoowla's content delivery network which will load the plugin. When submitted the form will also submit to the Hoowla Servers.
